                    <p>
                        Scientists all over the world are making many potential vaccines to reduce the chances of a person getting COVID-19 (World Health Organization,
                        2020). The vaccines develop are designed to help the body’s immune system to recognise and block the virus that causes a person to have COVID-19 safely (World Health Organization, 2020).

                        <h3>Inactivited Weakened Virus Vaccines</h3>
                        <p>
                            This type of vaccine uses a form of the virus which has been inactivated or weaken thus it would not cause one
                            to get COVID-19 (World Health Organization, 2020). Although the virus is being inactivated or weakened, it will still cause an immune response
                            (World Health Organization, 2020).

                            This vaccine uses fragments of proteins or protein shells that are harmless (World Health Organization, 2020). These protein fragments and protein shell simulate the COVID-19
                            virus to safely, bringing about an immune response (World Health Organization, 2020).

                            This vaccine uses genetically engineered virus thus it has no ability to cause diseases. However, the virus produces coronavirus proteins to trigger an immune response safely
                            (World Health Organization, 2020).

                        <p>
                            The COVID-19 vaccination programme aims to protect Singaporeans against COVID-19 and also the businesses and jobs when Singapore is continuously re-opening the country
                            (Ministry of Health, 2021). One way to prevent COVID-19 is to get vaccinated as it reduces the risk of transmission and also ensure that our health system do not get overwhelmed
                            (Ministry of Health, 2021). Also, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS)’s says that the vaccine is permissible for Muslim use thus the Muslims are able to take the
                            vaccination (Ministry of Health, 2021). It is critical for Singapore to have a large population being vaccinated as it will contribute to the safety of majority of the people
                            in Singapore (Ministry of Health, 2021). It will also impact those who are unfit to get vaccinated such as people who are severely immunocompromised or subgroups of people where
                            safety data is unavailable (Ministry of Health, 2021). They will benefit since the risk of transmission will be reduce significantly (Ministry of Health, 2021).

                            In Singapore, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was reviewed and endorsed for usage by people aged 16 years old and above (gov.sg, 2020). The vaccination will be carried out
                            gradually (gov.sg, 2020). Priority will be given to people who are most likely to be infected, including healthcare and frontline workers (gov.sg, 2020). People who are very
                            vulnerable to severe disease and complications if they are infected with COVID-19, including elderly and people with medical comorbidities will also be given priority (gov.sg, 2020).
                            Vaccinations for healthcare workers will begin on 30 December 2020 and for the elderly who are aged 70 years and above, it will start from February 2021 (gov.sg, 2020).

                    <h2>How do mRNA vaccines work?</h2>
                    <section class="exp-mRNA">
                        <p>
                            The mRNA vaccine contains messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) where it carries instructions to produce the spike protein of the coronavirus (Ministry of Health, 2021).
                            The mRNA used is synthesised and not taken from actual viruses (Ministry of Health, 2021). The mRNA will be given through intramuscular injection and the cells will take in
                            the vaccine, then producing the spike protein (Ministry of Health, 2021). This will stimulate the production of good antibody and cellular immune response to the spike
                            protein which will protect those who get vaccinated since the spike protein is a critical part of the SARS CoV-2 virus (Ministry of Health, 2021). However, these spike
                            proteins are unable to form SARS Cov-2 viruses or give rise to COVID-19 infection (Ministry of Health, 2021). The mRNA vaccine only lasts for two days before it is being
                            broken down by the body naturally (Ministry of Health, 2021). The vaccine does not enter the nucleus of the cells thus it has no capability of interfering with the DNA of
                            the person taking the injection (Ministry of Health, 2021).
