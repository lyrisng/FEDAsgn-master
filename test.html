			The Government has thus far borne the costs of stay at dedicated SHN facilities for travellers entering Singapore, except for those who left Singapore from 27 March 2020, despite the prevailing travel advisory. The Government has also borne the costs of the large majority of COVID-19 tests.
		</p>
		<p>
			As we re-open our borders to more international travel, those who enter Singapore would have to bear the costs of fulfilling these requirements, as part of the cost of travel in a COVID-19 world.
		
			From 17 June 2020, 2359 hours, all inbound and outbound travellers who enter or leave Singapore will be required to pay for their COVID-19 tests, where applicable.
		</p>
		<p>  All travellers, including Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, who last left Singapore from 27 March 2020 despite the prevailing travel advisory, will have to continue to bear the costs of their stay at dedicated SHN facilities where applicable, as well as the cost of their COVID-19 tests.

			From 17 June 2020, 2359 hours, all incoming travellers who are not Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents will be required to pay for their stay at dedicated SHN facilities, where applicable.

			If you test positive for COVID-19, know what protective steps to take if you are sick.
			Most people have mild COVID-19 illness and can recover at home without medical care. Contact your healthcare provider if your symptoms get worse or if you have questions about your health.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you test negative for COVID-19, you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected. This does not mean you will not get sick:
			A negative test result only means that you did not have COVID-19 at the time of testing or that your sample was collected too early in your infection.
		</p>
		<p>
			You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and then get infected and spread the virus to others.
			If you have symptoms later, you may need another test to determine if you are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
